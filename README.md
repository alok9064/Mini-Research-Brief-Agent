## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd Mini_Research_Brief
```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:  
```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set your Google API key:
```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"   # macOS/Linux
    set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here        # Windows (CMD)
```
## Run
```bash
    python mini_research_brief.py
```

Then enter a research topic (e.g., Impact of ONDC on small retailers in India).

Output

JSON (validated by Pydantic)
